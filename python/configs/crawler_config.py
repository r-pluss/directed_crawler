#this is an example of the crawler_config file format that is used as a config
#file for an instance of the Directed_Crawler class
#this config file can and should be changed for each project and is only used
#here as prototyping example

#remember to structure the file so that all functions referenced by expected 
#methods are declared first, as python does not have hoisting Ã  la javascript
